# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

<!-- MY ANSWERS ARE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW -->
<!-- I SUBMITTED ANSWERS ON THE 1ST SPRINT CHALLENGE AS COMMENTS, BUT THE GRADER SAID I HAD NOT. AGAIN, MY ANSWERS ARE THE COMMENTS BELOW -->

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
    <!-- ANSWER: Accessibility on the web, is the practice of designing for inclusivity, to remove/reduce barriers that would prevent people from using and interacting with a website -->

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.
    <!-- ANSWER: 
        (1) Use responsive design so that your website can be used across devices with different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, phone)
        (2) Use dynamic font-sizes that can change based on user input.  Avoid hard coding values that overwrite a users preferences.
        (3) Use semantic HTML, not only is this a good coding practice for others to understand your code, but it also allows individuals with screen readers to navigate your site more effectively.
        (4) Size images according to best practices. This will ensure that individuals without high-speed internet are able to load and use your site.
    -->
3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
    <!-- ANSWER: A variable is placeholder in the computer's memory for storing a value.  The variable will have a unique name and can store any type of data, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and more (e.g., null, undefined).  -->

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?
    <!-- ANSWER: Function allow you to protect a block of code, that will only run when called.  This also allows you to write code once but use repeatedly throughout you program.  -->

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?
    <!-- ANSWER: You can access a key via: 
        (1) Using dot notation IF you know the name of the key.  e.g. object.key 
        (2) Using bracket notation if you want to pass a variable as the key.  e.g. object[variableName], where the variable is a string that = the key name.
        (3) You can also use bracket notation if you know the name of the key, but dot notion is clearer.  e.g. object['key']
    -->

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and work on the main branch
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. connect to codegrade
5. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
6. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
7. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [X] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
